I'd know you better if you told me what you reread."

The following list of books are among my favorite books on information
security, business, leadership, and software development. I personally prefer
to listen them as audiobooks because I travel extensively and find that it is a
great way to gain new insights and fresh ideas. Frequently, I will end up
buying a paper copy of the book in addition to the audio because I find the
ideas contained in the book so compelling that I want to highlight it and mark
it up as a reference. For your convenience, you will find a hyperlink to each
book on Amazon.com. I am a Gold Member of
[Audible.com](https://www.audible.com/), and I have found that this has saved
me money on the audiobooks that I buy each month.

## Business & Leadership

#### [8 Ways to Great: Peak Performance on the Job and in Your Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JTHRO6/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=B003JTHRO6)
_—Doug Hirschhorn_

This is a quick read but very inspiring. The author has a novel perspective and
fresh insights.

#### [Getting Naked: A Business Fable About Shedding The Three Fears That Sabotage Client Loyalty (J-B Lencioni Series)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787976393/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0787976393&linkCode=as2&tag=kennetcom-20)
_—Patrick Lencioni_

This book is all about being real with clients. He argues that being vulnerable
with your clients creates strong bonds of loyalty. He states that however, if
you have to keep confessing screw-ups--it's not a vulnerability issue, it's a
competency issue. I loved the book. It was well written and very engaging.

#### [The Brand You 50 : Or : Fifty Ways to Transform Yourself from an 'Employee' into a Brand That Shouts Distinction, Commitment, and Passion!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375407723/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=0375407723)
_—Tom Peters_

Everyone who deals with clients and/or project work needs to read this. I
frequently flip through this book and it reminds me why I love the work that I
do. This book inspired me to move into more client-facing work. A couple of
great lines from this book that I quote often are "I am my Clients" and "Do
cool stuff every day--or die trying!" Tom Peters can be very irreverent, but
that's what makes his books so provocative.

#### [The Experience Economy: Work Is Theater & Every Business a Stage](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0875848192/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=0875848192)
_—B. Joseph Pine, James H. Gilmore_


I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to differentiate their
service business, particularly chapter 9. It will change how you think about
work. The authors discuss the radical idea of creating Transformational
Experiences for clients.

#### [Flow: The Classic Work on How to Achieve Happiness, with a new Introduction by the author](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0712657592/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0712657592&linkCode=as2&tag=kennetcom-20)
_—Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi_

When you lose all track of time you may be experiencing a flow state. Most
athletes and programmers have experienced this. This author has studied the
conditions that are conducive to flow--very interesting. I was originally
attracted to this book because of my study of martial arts, but the content is
applicable to all dimensions of life and work.

#### [The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0688103804/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=0688103804)
_—Kenneth H. Blanchard, William Oncken, Hal Burrows_

I am a big fan of the one minute manager books in general, but this one is
required reading for anyone on my team--so that we have a common language to
use in discussing how work gets done. Early in my career, I listened to a set
of audio tapes called "Managing Management Time" by William Onkin, a co-author
of this book that made a huge impact on how I lead organizations.

#### [The Present - the Gift That Makes You Happy And Successful At Work And in Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0972319514/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=0972319514)
_—Spencer Johnson M.D., Dennis Boutsikaris_

I discovered this book at a used book store and couldn't put it down.
Recommended reading for hard-charging "Type-A" people who need to remember to
stop &amp; smell the roses.

#### [GTD System Starter Kit (Vol one)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982013795/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=0982013795)
_—David Allen, Marian Bateman and Meg Edwards_

This has been a great investment to help keep me organized and enables me to
"live in The Present." I have also bought the Outlook Add-In, which I use to
track and feed an enormous amount of monkeys. It dovetails with many of the
other books on my list, but provided some valuable missing information. Until
reading this book, I had never been able to use Outlook's task functionality
because I would abandon them after continuing to generate paper lists and
post-it notes.

#### [Long Tail, The, Revised and Updated Edition: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401309666/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=1401309666)
_—Chris Anderson_

This book has shaped how I view the development of software for a niche
markets. The book does tend to be a little redundant as the author gives
multiple examples of how his concept can be extended into various markets and
business models.

#### [The Art of Profitability](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446692271/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=0446692271)
_—Adrian Slywotzky_

This book will give you lots to think about regarding how your business makes
money. The content is very deep but is presented as a narrative. I have the
audio book and listen to it every couple of years and get new insights each
time.

#### [The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: "On Robustness and Fragility"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081297381X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=081297381X)
_—Nassim Nicholas Taleb_

Black Swans are highly improbable events, that shake our understanding of the
way things are. I found this to be a fascinating survey of various schools of
philosophy and it certainly changed the way I look at the world. It can be a
little heady at times, but is certainly thought provoking.

#### [Rich Dad Poor Dad Classics - Boxed Set (Rich Dad Poor Dad; Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant, and Rich Dad's Guide to Investing)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586211676/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=1586211676)

Read everything that you can by Kiyosaki. This author and Tom Peters inspired
me to participate in the launch of Visonex. The Rich Dad books caused me to
rethink how I look at money.

_—Thomas L. Friedman_

This book will give you a new perspective on off-shoring. The author's premise
is "everything that can be outsourced will be." You need to read this to
understand the competitive forces shaping our economy.

#### [Fascinate: Your 7 Triggers to Persuasion and Captivation](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061714704/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=0061714704)
_—Sally Hogshead_

This book makes the point that we all want to be fascinated and we want others
to think that we are fascinating. There are seven fascination triggers--Lust,
Mystique. Alarm. Prestige, Power, Vice, and Trust. The author has an online
test on her website to help you determine which triggers you respond to. This
book shows how marketers "push our buttons" and how you and your brands can use
this insight to become more fascinating.

_—Harrison Monarth_

Executive presence is a textbook. It is jam packed with practical information
for any executive and deserves to be studied. I bought it on Kindle but then
also bought the hardcover so that I can highlight it and mark it up. Topics
covered include reading people and influencing the perceptions of others as
well as branding and online reputation management. The book includes very
interesting concepts and applications from research in the field of
organizational behavior.

_—Mike Cohn_

A good quick read on the process of figuring out what you want the software
that you are developing to do. The author suggests that you shift the focus to
the conversation with your users and that you capture the requirements in the
form of test statements that are related to the user story.

#### [Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321534468/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kennetcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creative ASIN=0321534468)

_—Frederick P. Brooks_

This book contains the incredible wisdom of Frederick Brooks. Brooks was a
software project manager during the early days of software development at IBM.
He coined the well-loved project management phrase, "Nine women can't make a
baby in a month." His book discusses many of the problems that agile
development methodologies attempt to address. His wisdom and use of metaphors
makes the book quite readable.
