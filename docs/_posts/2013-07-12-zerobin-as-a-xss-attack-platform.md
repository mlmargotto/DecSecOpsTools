_What if you could have hundreds of websites from which to launch an
encrypted cross-site-scripting attack?_

_What if the webservers could store the XSS attack code for you but could
not decrypt it?_

_What if the encrypted code could be set to expire after a set time or
immediately after attacking a single person?_

As it turns out, many reputable (and not so reputable) web hosts across the
internet are hosting ZeroBin PHP code that is vulnerable to XSS.  ZeroBin is an
open source project authored by Sebastien Sauvage, and hosted on his
[web page](http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:zerobin).
The ZeroBin project received considerable publicity after
[Information Week](http://www.informationweek.com/security/vulnerabilities/anonymous-builds-new-haven-for-stolen-da/232900590)
and
[Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/04/anonymous-builds-its-own-pastebin-like-site/)
wrote articles in April 2012 about Anonymous selecting ZeroBin for
their AnonPaste data-sharing sites.  This move by Anonymous was in response to
the PasteBin announcement that they were starting to increase the monitoring of
the content posted to PasteBin.

In the past year, multiple blog posts have been written about the utility of
ZeroBin and several sites now host the vulnerable code.  The ZeroBin Project
maintains a version history and while all current versions are vulnerable,
Alpha 0.18 (the current version) added a robot meta tag to prevent search
engines from indexing the page.

A Google dork was used to find all of the vulnerable Alpha 0.15 systems
(http://www.google.com/?q=intitle:zerobin+-site:github.com+%22Alpha+0.15%22)
which at the time of this writing is 132 hits.  There are likely to be many
more systems out there at the Alpha 0.18 version level that are not crawled by
GoogleBot.  Version 0.18 systems will still show up in search results if a user
posts a hyperlink to pasted content.

A hyperlink to a ZeroBin posting has a query string that consists of two parts:

* A unique identifier to the content stored on the ZeroBin server, and
* An AES 256 Encryption key

Separating the two components is a number sign symbol, effectively making the
browser treat the encryption key as a bookmark that it does not transmit to the
ZeroBin server.  All encrypt and decrypt operations happen in the browser.  The
full hyperlink, including the key can be exchanged with others via email,
instant messanger, or message boards and can be reduced by any common URL
shortener that does not remove bookmarks from the URL.  An interesting feature
is the pasted content can expire immediately after it is read (executed) once
using the “Burn after reading” option.  The content will also expire after
a set time.  Refer to the project website for more details.

I discovered the XSS vulnerability after hearing colleagues discussing ZeroBin
and out of force of habit plunked in the standard <script>Alert("XSS")</script>
to see what would happen.  Up popped the message box, indicating the
vulnerability.

Note that the newer web browsers are attempting to mitigate
cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities, so Internet Explorer 10 will not permit
the pop-up, but IE 9 will.

OWASP has made the dangers of XSS well known, but there are still too many
occurrences on the internet.  This particular vulnerability is particularly
troubling because the attack hyperlink could be from a trusted domain and
forensic analysis is made more complicated due to the nature of the ZeroBin
architecture.

The good news is that the fix is very straightforward. Sanitize the input and
output.  For the Alpha 0.18 version, this can be done by modifying the
zerobin.js file as described below.

Change line 198 from:

```
setElementText($('div#cleartext'), cleartext);
```

To:

```
$('div#cleartext').text(cleartext).html();
```

Change line 353 from:

```
setElementText($('div#cleartext'), $('textarea#message').val());
```

To:

```
$('div#cleartext').text($('textarea#message').val()).html();
```
