From a compliance perspective, organizations need to have a hardening standard 
derived from an authoritative source with solid engineering-based reasons of 
why we depart from any of the recommendations.  Most organizations use the 
Center for Internet Security (CIS) Hardening Benchmarks because that choice is 
easy to defend.  The CIS benchmarks reflect industry consensus around hardening 
best practices and therefore adopting the benchmarks is an example of due care.

A hardening standard is intended to be a shared, living document that evolves 
with threats and lessons learned by the organization via a change control 
process. To ensure consistency and follow DevOps principles, the application of 
the hardening standard should be scripted and managed via change control.  It 
should also be audited to ensure that the expected configuration remains in 
place over time.  I have found that Lynis (<a 
href="https://cisofy.com/lynis/">https://cisofy.com/lynis/</a>), an open source 
tool is is a great way to audit a system for CIS benchmark compliance.

Obviously, there are multiple ways to script the implementation of the 
hardening guidance.  Here is an example for Ubuntu 14 that simply modifies the 
weak, default security settings of the base OS as distributed  <a
