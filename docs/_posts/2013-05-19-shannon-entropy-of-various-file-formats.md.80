In yesterday’s [post](/blog/calculate-file-entropy/), I introduced a tool 
(graph_file_entropy.py) that I created to visualize the frequency distribution 
of the bytes in a file.  For today, I will show the results of using this tool 
for a cursory examination of the Shannon entropy of various, common file 
formats.  This will illustrate benefits and limitations of using Shannon 
entropy to indicate possible encryption.

## File 1 – TestDoc.DOCX

For a representative MS Word file that would be similar to what might be found 
on any computer, I used the word file to create the <a 
href="/media/Understanding-the-Role-of-Trust-in-the-Protection-of-Privacy.pdf">U
nderstanding the Role of Trust in the Protection of Privacy</a> PDF file and 
named it “TestDoc.docx.”  Note that docx is the default file extension of 
MS Word 2010.

The frequency distribution of the DOCX file is fairly uniform, with the 
exception of a relatively high occurrence of bytes with the value of zero.

## File 2 -  TestDoc.DOC

Next, I saved TestDoc in the <em>Word 97 – 2003</em> format.  This format has 
the DOC extension and produced the non-uniform distribution that I was 
expecting of File 1.

## File 3 – TestDoc.TXT

TestDoc was also saved as plain text.  Running graph_file_entropy.py produced 
the following result.

## File 4 – TestDoc.RTF

I repeated the process after saving the file in rich text format.

## File 5 – TestDoc.PDF

The TestDoc.PDF file has more entropy than the any of the other files we have 
examined thus far.

## File 6 – TestDoc.GPG

To generate File 6, I encrypted the TestDoc.DOCX with Gpg4win (GNU Privacy 
Guard for Windows).  The result is a file with a very high entropy of 7.9945 
out of a possible max of 8.0.

## File 7 – WINWORD.EXE

For comparison purposes, I thought that it would be interesting to find the 
entropy of a common executable, MS Word 2010.  I copied the WINWORD.EXE file 
into my working directory and ran graph_file_entropy.py to produce its 
corresponding distribution chart.

Like the chart for the DOCX file, this chart is skewed by a high frequency of 
bytes with a value of zero.

## File 8 – Regular-MP3.mp3

I was also curious of the entropy of MP3 files.  I copied the <em>So Caught up 
in You</em> MP3 by the classic rock band “38 Special” into my working 
directory and renamed it “Regular-MP3.mp3” for the purpose of testing.

![Regular-MP3.mp3](/images/Regular-MP3-1024x464.png)

The MP3 file format is very compressed, so it is not a surprise that it has 
high entropy.

## File 9 – Compressed-MP3.7z

The Regular-MP3 file was compressed using 7-Zip, a popular file compression 
utility to get the Compressed-MP3.7z that I processed next.

## File 10 – GPG-Encrypted-MP3.gpg

I encrypted the Regular-MP3 file using Gpg4win in a manner similar to File 6.

## Observations

The following table summarizes the results I obtained from running 
graph_file_entropy.py:

![Summary of Results](/images/Summary.png)

My observations show that although the Regular-MP3 file is compressed already, 
7-zip was able to compress it more.  When compressed with 7-zip, it has very 
high entropy and cannot be compressed further.  Another interesting observation 
is that the GPG encryption process also compressed the size of the file in both 
cases that I used it.
