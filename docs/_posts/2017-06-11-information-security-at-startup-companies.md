## Question:

_How can a young professional convince startups that InfoSec is needed? And
then get them to hire him? I am currently studying InfoSec Management
and I am looking to get a job at startups as this will provide me room to grow
and experiment with less of an impact. How can I convince them it is needed and
that I am their guy?_

## Ken Hartman:

Great topic and great discussion so far. I have a different perspective to add
to the mix. Find a startup that is in a regulated industry so that it that must
have a security management program to be in compliance. Clients of this type of
business WILL have it built into their contracts. Make sure the management team
understands business management and not just their technology.  Security is all
about managing risk. Startups are constantly faced with prioritizing risks—so
make sure that you have the appetite for that.

I joined what became a successful startup 10 years ago (Visonex.com) and we
understood “brand” was everything. It was very clear to us that we had to
protect the trust our clients were placing in our brand. Good security controls
are good management.  The best companies bake security into their way of
managing business, just like they bake quality in. This does not happen by
accident, it takes a sustained top management commitment to organizational
process maturity—but this is exactly what it will take the startup to
survive. Various security frameworks can provide you with a roadmap (and hence
ideas that you can contribute to the company).

So here is my advice: Remember that YOU are also interviewing the company. Look
for a company that “gets it.” And yes, be prepared to wear many hats…but
that is what makes it so fun.
