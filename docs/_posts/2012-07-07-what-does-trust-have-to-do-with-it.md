_Here is latest installment from the HIMSS Privacy and Security
Committee…called **PSST!**. Keep reading to learn more about the column and
this month’s topic – Patient Trust _by [Kenneth G. Hartman, CISSP, CPHIMS, GSEC](https://kennethghartman.com/)

The HIMSS Privacy and Security Committee chose the topic of Patient Trust as
the “PSST” for the month of June to coordinate with the release of a new
white paper titled [Understanding the Role of Trust in the Protection of Privacy](/media/Understanding-the-Role-of-Trust-in-the-Protection-of-Privacy.pdf)_.
This latest addition to the [HIMSS Privacy & Security Toolkit](http://www.himss.org/library/healthcare-privacy-security/toolkit?navItemNumber=16480)is
the result of the P&S Committee’s desire to increase understanding of
Privacy as a separate and distinct concept from Security.

Those of us who have worked in healthcare for any length of time routinely
handle patient information.  We are expected to be aware of all of the
compliance requirements and organizational policies pertaining to the proper
handling of protected health information.  We are also busy and often
short-handed, yet for the most part, we do our jobs well and protect the rights
of our patients in the process.

This blog posting isn’t about:

* what we need to know,
* how we need to comply, or
* what we should do differently.

Rather, it is an encouragement to pause for a moment and to think about
“WHY.”

The aforementioned
[whitepaper](/media/Understanding-the-Role-of-Trust-in-the-Protection-of-Privacy
.pdf) delves into why it is important to understand that there is an important
linkage between trust and privacy.  In addition to discussing various privacy
legislation enacted to preserve societal trust, the paper also delves into the
more personal issues of vulnerability, fairness, and competence.

Without giving away the complete gist of the paper, let’s think about what
trust has to do with what we do:

* We are all patients, not just providers, payors, or healthcare IT
professionals  
* We are much more than our medical records  
* We know that information can be taken out of context or potentially could
just be plain wrong  
* We want control over our own lives, generally  
* We trust those that we know well and may lack trust in those that we do not
know  
* We know that we have to let others help us sometimes, and this takes trust  

As professionals who work in the field of healthcare, we have more insight into
how “the system” works, so we will naturally be more trusting of it.
However, different people will have different attitudes about trust, because we
are all different and have had different life experiences.

Bruce Schneier, in his book _Liars & Outliers – Enabling the Trust that
Society Needs to Survive_, writes the following:

> In some ways, trust in society works like oxygen in the atmosphere.  The more
customers trust merchants, the easier commerce is.  The more drivers trust
other drivers, the smoother traffic flows.  Trust gives people the confidence
to deal with strangers: because they know that the strangers are likely to
behave honestly, cooperatively, fairly, and sometimes even altruistically.  The
more trust is in the air, the healthier society is and the more it can thrive.
Conversely, the less trust is in the air, the sicker society is and the more it
has to contract.  And if the amount of trust gets too low, society withers and
dies.

Trust is earned by being trustworthy.  A big part of that is to understand
patients’ expectations regarding privacy and keeping the promises we make to
protect that privacy.
