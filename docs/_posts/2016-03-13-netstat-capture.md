Several years ago, I created a
 [PowerShell script]("/blog/powershell-script-to-log-network-connections/")
to create a log of outbound connections.  What if you need something
quick and dirty and cannot use a script like that or external tools like
Process Explorer, etc?

Here is a batch script that runs in an infinite loop and catches changes to the
output of netstat:

```
#netstat-changes.bat
#Capture changes to a netstat output
netstat -naob > old.txt
:loop
netstat -naob > new.txt
fc old.txt new.txt >> change.txt
copy /y new.txt old.txt
goto loop

```

The output is certainly not pretty, but it gets the job done.
