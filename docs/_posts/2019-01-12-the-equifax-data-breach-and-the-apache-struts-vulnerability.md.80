Last week (9/7/2017), Equifax <a 
href="https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/consumer-notice/">announced</a> that 
on July 29 they discovered that an exploited web application vulnerability was 
being used to access a trove of consumer information for the previous 2 ½ 
months, until discovery.  Various news outlets, such as the <a 
href="http://nypost.com/2017/09/08/equifax-blames-giant-breach-on-vendor-softwar
e-flaw/">New York Post</a> are starting to report that the web application 
vulnerability that was exploited is the recent <a 
href="https://struts.apache.org/docs/s2-052.html">Apache Struts Remote Code 
Execution Vulnerability</a>, that has been designated as <a 
href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9805">CVE-2017-9805
</a>.

In the <a 
href="http://nypost.com/2017/09/08/equifax-blames-giant-breach-on-vendor-softwar
e-flaw/">NY Post Article</a>, an analyst at RW Baird &amp; Co named Jeffery 
Meuler is cited as the source of this information, based on a phone call that 
he had with an Equifax representative in preparation for a <a 
href="https://baird.bluematrix.com/docs/pdf/dbf801ef-f20e-4d6f-91c1-88e55503ecb0
.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research bulletin</a> that 
Baird Equity Research published the day of the Equifax announcement.  This 
bulletin states that:

<em>Our understanding is that data entered (and retained) through consumer 
portals/interactions (consumers inquiring about their credit reports, disputes, 
etc.) and data around it was breached via the Apache Struts flaw.</em>

# What is the Apache Struts Flaw?

Apache Struts (<a 
href="https://struts.apache.org/">https://struts.apache.org/</a>) is a 
framework for creating Java web Applications and REST application programming 
interfaces (API).  An API is how various systems on the Internet communicate 
with each other.  The data exchanged via an API is typically 
<em>serialized</em> into either JSON or XML.

When you think about the type of data that a company might collect about you, 
such as your current and previous addresses, employers, and credit card 
numbers, it is understandable that the data structure that gets flattened out 
into XML would be very complex.  The security problem arises when the recipient 
system tries to <em>deserialize</em> the data stream so that it can process the 
data.

The word “deserialize” and its many technical descriptions are very 
intimidating, but it essentially means that the data stream needs to be parsed 
so that meaning can be assigned to the various data elements in the stream.  
The flexibility demanded of deserialization libraries are their undoing, 
because the stream can contain binary data as well as text and numbers.  In the 
case of this vulnerability, a malicious manipulation of the XML results in the 
attacker being able to execute remote code on the victim server.  The Sophos 
Naked Security blog has a very readable <a 
href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/09/06/apache-struts-serialisation-vu
lnerability-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer 
noopener">explanation</a> of this vulnerability and serialization.

# The Exploit is in the Wild

On September 5, at 15:30 BST (7:30 AM Pacific Time), the security researcher 
that publicized the Struts vulnerability did so on his <a 
href="https://lgtm.com/blog/apache_struts_CVE-2017-9805_announcement">company 
blog</a> in concert with the release of the <a 
href="https://struts.apache.org/announce.html#a20170905">Struts update 
announcement</a> regarding <a 
href="https://struts.apache.org/docs/s2-052.html">S2-052</a>.  One day later, a 
<a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42627/">functional exploit</a> was 
uploaded to the Exploit Database and has a <a 
href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/struts2_rest_xstream"
>Metasploit module</a>.

This attack vector is referred to by OWASP as the “<a 
href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data">deseria
lization of untrusted data</a>,” which explains that <em>“[d]ata which is 
untrusted cannot be trusted to be well formed. Malformed data or unexpected 
data could be used to abuse application logic, deny service, or execute 
arbitrary code, when deserialized.”</em>

Roughly eighteen months ago, there was an uptick of security research on the 
topic, including a whitepaper published by an HPE security researcher named 
Alvaro Munoz, named “<a href="/dead-link/"  target="_blank">the perils of 
Java deserialization</a>.”  In the whitepaper, Munoz specifically called out 
XStream (the target of this Struts exploit) speculating how its protections 
could be bypassed.

# Mitigating this Type of Vulnerability

The SANS Security Awareness Blog has published a helpful <a 
href="/dead-link/">post for security awareness officers to communicate 
regarding the Equifax hack</a>, reminding us to stick to the facts and that it 
is not the victim’s fault.  I agree.  However, this is also a tremendous 
opportunity to raise developer and executive awareness regarding application 
security best practices.  Toward that end, here are some recommendations:


## 1. Do not deserialize untrusted data
But what does this really mean? In this sense, “trust” has a specific 
context, which essentially means that if you have not had complete control of 
the data since its original creation, you <em>must assume</em> that it is 
unsafe.  It is often beneficial to think about how data crosses <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_boundary">trust boundaries</a> or put 
more simply, how does data get into your application?

## 2. Authenticate before deserialization

Don’t trust strangers.  Authenticate the source of the data before deciding 
to trust it.  This will prevent many of the automated types of attacks, such as 
the Metasploit exploit described above.

## 3. Limit the data types that can be deserialized

Do not deserialize binary data if you don’t need to serialize it.  In his <a 
href="https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/Security-Research/The-perils-of-Java-des
erialization/ba-p/246211#.WbQB2MiGOUk">paper</a>, Munoz noted that XStream 
supports blacklisting and whitelisting the classes that can be deserialized, 
but pointed out that many implementations do not use this feature.

## 4. Avoiding writing your own parsers

In general, parsing untrusted data is risky, and deserialization is a subset of 
parsing.  Libraries such as Struts and Springs may have multiple published 
vulnerabilities, but they benefit from considerable public scrutiny.  It is 
safer to use these libraries than to reinvent the wheel and make the same 
security mistakes in novel ways.

## 5. Scan your code

While these tools have their limitations, static and dynamic application 
scanners catch the vast majority of the known vulnerabilities and are updated 
rapidly after these types of vulnerabilities become public (and sometimes 
before, when the vulnerability is <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure">responsibly 
disclosed</a>). Strive for full code coverage.

## 6. Inventory and authorize your code libraries

Right now, more than one CISO is losing sleep as to whether or not his or her 
organization is using Struts.  This is compounded by the fact that much of the 
software that organizations use is not written by internal developers.  Many 
scanning tools will flag vulnerabilities in the dependent libraries, but only 
if that code is scanned.  Companies that require that all code is stored in 
approved code repositories and have a security review and authorization process 
for code libraries have an advantage when responding to critical security 
vulnerability notices.

## 7. Educate management

Vulnerability management is expensive.  This includes commercial scanners, 
penetration testing, security management processes and auditing.  However, 
breaches are more expensive.  When bad things happen, like the Equifax breach, 
it opens a window of opportunity to inform management how and why the security 
infrastructure that they are investing in is designed to help manage security 
risks.

## 8. Learn from Others

This breach will generate lots of discussion in the months and years to come.  
I also predict that CVE-2017-9805 will plague many for quite some time.  I 
expect that there will be considerably more research into deserialization 
vulnerabilities.  In fact a second, brand new Struts vulnerability was 
announced yesterday <a 
href="https://struts.apache.org/docs/s2-053.html">(CVE-2017-12611, S2-53</a>).  
To cope, our best response is to continue to learn, share, and adapt.  An 
excellent example of this is Paypal’s January 2016 posting called, <em><a 
href="https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2016/01/21/lessons-learned-from-the-jav
a-deserialization-bug/">Lessons Learned from the Java Deserialization 
Bug</a></em>.
