The US Federal Government requires that its agencies protect sensitive, but 
unclassified information using cryptographic modules that have been validated 
to <a 
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf">Federal 
Information Processing (FIPS) Standard 140-2 “Security Requirements for 
Cryptographic Modules.</a>”  This standard replaced its predecessor, FIPS 
140-1.  In this context, the term “validated” means tested by accredited 
testing organizations to demonstrate that the module itself provides a specific 
level of security assurance.

To fully understand what FIPS 140-2 validation of a particular security 
product, it is important to understand the contextual meaning of “module” 
as defined by the standard:

**Cryptographic module**: the set of hardware, software, and/or firmware that 
implements approved security functions (including cryptographic algorithms and 
key generation) and is contained within the cryptographic boundary.</em>

In the field of information security, the concept of a security boundary is of 
vital importance.  Security is assurance (to a specific level) is only offered 
within a specific, defined boundary.  In other words, if a certain HSM has FIPS 
140-2 validation it can be trusted to perform its cryptographic functions 
securely <em>within the limits of the defined level of security</em>.  However, 
it is still possible to implement an HSM in an insecure manner making the FIPS 
140-2 validation misleading to a layman who does not understand the limitations 
of the validation.  The Overview section of the standard even contains the 
following caveat:

<em>Similarly, the use of a validated cryptographic module in a computer or 
telecommunications system is not sufficient to ensure the security of the 
overall system.</em>

Discussions regarding FIPS 140-2 typically involve a determination of what 
<em>level</em> of security is appropriate.  The FIPS 140-2 Standard defines 
four different levels:

* **Security Level 1** – This is the lowest level of security. While only 
approved security functions or algorithms may be used there are no specific 
physical security requirements.  This security level allows the cryptographic 
module to be implemented in software.  The standard reads, “Security Level 1 
allows the software and firmware components of a cryptographic module to be 
executed on a general purpose computing system using an unevaluated operating 
system.”

* **Security Level 2** – Requires tamper-evidence as a physical security 
measure. This is typically implemented by using special coatings or seals of 
physical boundary of the security module.  In addition, the operating system 
must meet the specified Common Criteria Protection Profiles listed in the 
Standard’s Annex B.  As a result of these requirements the security module 
must take on a specific form factor and is listed as a specific product on the 
<a 
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/1401vend.htm">list</a
> maintained by NIST.  Security Level 2 also requires role-based authentication.

* **Security Level 3** – Attempts to thwart an attacker from obtaining the 
plaintext secrets (called “critical security parameters” by the standard) 
by securely wiping the memory when the module is tampered with. Level 3 
requires that the plaintext secrets moved in or out of the cryptographic module 
use a trusted path to protect their integrity and confidentiality.

* **Security Level 4**–This is the highest and most rigorous level of 
security and is suitable for operation in physically unprotected environments. 
The goal at this security level is to detect and thwart all manner of physical 
access attempts, including manipulations of voltage or temperature, destroying 
the secrets if necessary.

The four different levels of security allow the data owner to determine the 
level of security that is warranted based on the data’s classification and 
the threat model.  Additional security comes at an increasing cost.  Since it 
is expensive for the device manufacturers to obtain FIPS 140-2 validation for 
each product, this expense is baked into the cost of the unit.
