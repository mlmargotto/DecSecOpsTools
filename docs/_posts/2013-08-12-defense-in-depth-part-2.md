[Last post](/blog/defense-in-depth/), I discussed the concept of
defense-in-depth (DiD) where overlapping controls provide increased security,
particularly if one of the controls should happen to fail. Now, I will give a
specific example—host-based firewalls.

Both the Windows and Linux operating systems have firewalling capabilities
built into the OS. Frequently, I will find that the local system firewall has
been turned off. This is especially true with Linux servers because iptables,
the Linux firewall process, can take some kung fu to properly configure. When
asked why iptables is off, the system owner will typically say that there is no
need for it because the system is protected by the network firewall. When I
hear this, I recognize that the architecture is missing a valuable DiD layer.

As an example, let’s discuss a Linux web server. For discussion purposes,
let’s assume that the system is deployed as a web server that serves web
content on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https). The system may also run secure
shell on port 22 for remote administration. In this case, the network firewall
will be configured to pass in traffic destined for these ports, but one should
take the time to configure iptables as well. Why? Remember, that the idea
behind defense-in-depth is to provide additional protection when another
control fails. How would the network perimeter firewall fail? Well, it could
get misconfigured to allow unwanted traffic, or it could be circumvented.

You may even want to configure iptables to log connection attempts on any
unauthorized ports, which in our example is 80, 443, and 22. If you do that,
then your monitored logs will alert you to the high probability of an intrusion
attempt. Also, iptables can help prevent malware or unauthorized processes on
the server from opening additional ports or making remote connections to the
outside. If you have iptables configured to block outgoing connections, then a
log recorded on the network firewall indicating an outbound connection has much
more weight as an indication of a compromise.

To add an additional layer of security, an intrusion detection system can be
employed between the network firewall and the webserver. If you use an IDS,
take the time to whitelist the specific ports that are authorized in both the
firewall and the host firewall.

Another example of DiD is to ensure that your logs can be correlated. Consider
the path that legitimate traffic will take to the webserver. It will flow
through the firewall, possibly an intrusion detection system or web application
firewall and load balancers to the host firewall and then ultimately to the web
service. If somehow an attacker manages to circumvent a protection layer, it
will be evident in some logs but not the logs of the systems that were
circumvented. Also, if an attacker manages to corrupt or tamper with a log, the
other logs will provide insight. Oh, and by the way, make sure that each
logging process is configured to log the appropriate data elements. For
example, the default Windows web server (IIS) log settings are generally
inadequate to provide useful forensic insight.

Defense-in-depth takes thoughtful consideration and even some testing to get it
right, but the peace of mind is well worth the effort.
