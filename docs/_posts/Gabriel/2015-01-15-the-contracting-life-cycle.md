Just as there is a life cycle for software development, there is a life cycle
for contracting and this cycle must be managed as well to assure information
security for the organization.  While there are a variety of formal models
promoted by contract management software vendors, the typical phases include:

* vendor selection
* negotiation
* contract creation
* managing contract change
* compliance monitoring, and
* contract renewal or termination.

Information security has an important role to play in each of these phases,
from vetting the security posture of the vendor and assessing the security of
their product offerings to assisting with compliance monitoring.  Many
companies do a decent job at vendor selection and even create an excellent
security addendum for their contracts.  However, many companies fail to
effectively monitor the vendor's compliance with the contract in general and
the security addendum in particular.  One of my mantras is "you must inspect
what you expect."  Document in the security addendum how you will audit
compliance, and then do it!
