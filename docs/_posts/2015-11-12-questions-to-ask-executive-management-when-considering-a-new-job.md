It is common wisdom that the interview process is a two-way street.  You should
be interviewing the company that you are considering working for to determine
if you will be a good fit for the culture and values of the company.  If you
get a chance to talk to executive management, you will certainly want to be
prepared.  What questions will you ask?  Contrary to popular opinion, I do
think that there is such a thing as a dumb question.  After all, you do not
want to destroy your credibility by lack of preparation.  Here is a list of
some ideas, but just select a few:

## On the Culture & Growth:

* What kind of person succeeds here?
* How do you define culture?
* How would you characterize your management style? and those of the folks on
your team?
* Whose careers have you influenced the most?
* What do you, personally, do to  continue to grow?

## On the Future:

* What are your customers telling you is their biggest unmet needs?
* How do you see the needs of the company's market changing in the next few
years?
* How will the company look different in the next 3-5 years?
* What excites you the most about the future of the company?

## Deeper Questions:

_NOTE: Make sure that it is appropriate to ask these questions! These
require a higher level of rapport with the person you are talking to._

* Tell me about {name a key person} who has recently left the company?
* What about employee turnover?
* What is the toughest decision that you have had to make recently?
* What is the most important thing that you are working on right now?
* What keeps you awake at night?

## What to look for:

When listening (and observing) the answers  to these questions, I look for
honesty and openness. Executive leadership sets the tone for a company. Do the
answers convey integrity or evasiveness?  Displays of passion are important,
but is there also a depth that inspires confidence?  Would you hire this
management team to lead the company that you decide to work for?
