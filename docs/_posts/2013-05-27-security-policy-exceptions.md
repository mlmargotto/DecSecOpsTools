Not long ago, I was reading a debate on a Linkedin.com forum discussing all
kinds of edge cases that some participants were arguing needed to be considered
in a security policy regarding some particular aspect of security.  In fact, I
forget what the issue was, but it was clear that the folks in the discussion
were losing sight of the big picture.

Information security is about managing risks.  Security Policy is a written
statement by management that provides high-level, directional guidance about
how to manage the risk that is the topic of the policy.  Policies are approved
by executive management after they understand the policy, and how the
countermeasures in the policy address the risks that the policy addresses.
Risks can rarely be eliminated in entirety.  Generally, the goal is to reduce
the risks to an acceptable level.  Therefore, if a security policy can address
the majority of the information security risks with the exception of some edge
cases—it is still a good security policy.

What about the edge cases that are still a concern?  This is where a
_Security Policy Exception Process_ should come into play.  The Security
Policy Exception Process should identify the specific places where there issues
with policy compliance so that the issue is elevated to the proper level of
management to ensure that the risk is recognized and if appropriate, managed
with a compensating control.

A simple way to implement a Security Policy Exception Process is to use your
organization’s ticketing system.  This way, open tickets that pertain to
security policy exceptions can be reviewed regularly and closed when the
exception has been rectified.  It is better to have a system to accommodate
exceptions to security policy and thereby communicate areas of risk than to
think that there is 100% compliance to all security policy.  Information
Security is about reducing risk, not eliminating it—that is the big picture.
