Recently, I reread a John C. Maxwell book entitled _The 17 Indisputable Laws
of Teamwork._ In this book, Maxwell has a chapter dedicated to the _Law
of the Scoreboard, _which is "The team can make adjustments when it knows
where it stands." In sports, the scoreboard is the objective measure of each
team's performance. However, the other areas of life are much more subjective
and difficult to measure.

Performance measurement is a full-time occupation for some management
consultants, typically because substantial sums of money are involved. As we
are all aware, health care is trending toward _pay for performance_ in
an attempt to improve quality. Naturally the performance metrics used will
reinforce a few specific behaviors that are rewarded, regardless of whether the
behaviors actually improve quality or only improve the "score." For example,
measuring the frequency of physician visits will increase the pressure to see
the patient more often, _but for a shorter duration. _As a result, this
example has an unintended consequence of shorter durations.

Therefore it is important to make sure that the metrics selected will
accurately measure quality and not just a single facet that can be improved at
the sake of other _unmeasured_ components of quality.

In sports, if you find out the score after the game is over, it is too late to
make adjustments. For the same reason, the performance must be measured in a
timely manner so that the feedback is current enough to be meaningful.

> I have observed two extremesâ€”some teams do not keep score and others spend
more time keeping score than _playing the game._ The art is in striking
the right balance.

For your operation, ask yourself:

* Are we measuring the proper things?
* Do our measurements produce unintended consequences?
* Are our measurements timely enough to make a difference?
* How can we reduce the score-keeping burden?
