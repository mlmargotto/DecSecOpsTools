While recently accompanying an executive as he visited four newly acquired
dialysis facilities for the first time, I was struck once again by the
importance of **Management by Wandering Around** (MBWA)*. Intentionally
wandering through your organization allows you, as a leader, to observe reality
and hear concerns from the front line in an informal manner. When you listen,
it sends a powerful message that you truly do care. When talking with others, I
try to remember to put them at ease, by considering their communication style.
Certain people like to get right down to business, while others want to create
a personal connection by discussing something safe, like the weather, at first.

At the other end of the spectrum, is **Management by Objectives** (MBO). MBO
maps each person’s performance goals to company strategy. This is a more
formal strategy, and certainly has its place. Each employee should understand
how their contribution fits into their group, department, and the entire
organization. Progress toward the objectives should be discussed regularly on
both a formal and informal basis. Your staff knows what is important to
you—it’s the items that you check up on.

Lastly, there is one other technique—**Management by Exception** (MBE). MBE
tracks the specific key performance indicators of a process and flags the
output that is not at an acceptable level. MBE can be a very useful tool, and
the effort of deciding what to measure and how to measure it provides very
important discussion topics for your teams. Information systems, can ease the
score-keeping burden, but the discussion is still crucial.

As a leader, you want to establish the strategy (MBO) and operating parameters
(MBE) and then inspire and fuel the discussion by MBWA.

*Tom Peters first introduced the concept of MBWA in his book, “In Search of
Excellence.” Here's an [excellent article on the MBWA](http://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/Jones6.html).
