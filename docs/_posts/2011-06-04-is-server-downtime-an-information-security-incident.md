## Question:

Hi everyone, Information Security is about protecting the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability (CIA) of Information Assets. So can someone tell
me, at what point does availability become an issue? for instance, is server
downtime an information security incident even if it was due to a technical
fault?

## Ken Hartman:

Here are my thoughts:
* This is a question that every company will need to answer for themselves.  
Every organization has different security needs and different compliance  
requirements. Thanks for raising the issue. This is an important question that  
security managers need to ask their organizations to ensure that their security  
management program is meeting the needs of their organization.  

* The title of the person addressing the availability issue is less important  
than the fact that someone is ultimately responsible for addressing the root  
cause of the availability issue.  

* To build on an earlier point, security controls need to ensure that there is  
a framework for communication and timely corrective action. For many  
organizations, this may very well be their IT Case Management system.  

* As part of our security awareness efforts, we must create an understanding  
that security (Including all parts of the CIA triad) is part of everyone’s  
job. Part of this is by building bridges with the larger IT organization.  
Calling an availability issue a “security incident” need not shift the  
responsibility to the security team to resolve it, but should instead highlight  
how everyone plays a role in security. Securing our organizations is too big of  
a task for just the security team.  

* Organizations may want to define a “threshold of impact” to use to filter  
availability issues because “you can’t drain the ocean” and some  
situations clearly deserve more formal incident handling.  

**NOTE:** Many organizations now consider _the intent to cause harm_ when
determining if it is something that should involve the security team versus
just the operations team.
