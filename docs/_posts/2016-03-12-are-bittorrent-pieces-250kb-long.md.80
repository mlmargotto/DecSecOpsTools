I was researching BitTorrent and noticed in the <a 
href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html" target="_blank" 
rel="noreferrer noopener">Specification</a> that it said that the typical 
length of a Piece was 250 kilobytes long.  That made me curious so I decided to 
perform some quick research to determine the extent of variation.

First, I modified the <a href="https://github.com/Resistor52/bittorrent-parser" 
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitTorrent Parser</a> that I had 
created previously to append data to a “statistics.csv” file.  The <a 
href="https://github.com/Resistor52/bittorrent-parser/blob/master/getfiles.sh" 
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getfiles.sh</a> script downloaded a 
279 files from <a href="http://www.legittorrents.com">www.legittorrents.com</a> 
of which 169 were unique.

After pulling the [raw data](/media/statistics.csv) into MS Excel, 
de-duplicating it, and graphing it, I came up with the chart below:

![Metainfo_Statistics_by_Torrent_Size](/images/Metainfo_Statistics_by_Torrent_Si
ze.png)

Note that the Y-Axis is Log-2.

Fourty-Four percent of the sampled Metainfo files were for a torrent that was 
under 1 Gb.  Of these 76 Metainfo files that correspond to smaller torrents, 
all but 5 had a piece size of 250Kb and these 5 files were all for torrents 
that are under ½ Gb in size.

At the other end of the spectrum, 7% of the Metainfo files correspond to 
torrents that are larger than 10 Gb.  All of the Metainfo files in this group 
had piece sizes that were 2 Mb or larger.

According to its Metainfo file, the largest torrent in the sample was 61.5 Gb 
and its piece size is 16 Mb.

The Metainfo file in the sample with the largest number of pieces (39,975) is 
for a torrent that is 9.76 Gb in size, and its piece size is that standard 250 
Kb.

## Conclusion

Although this sample is too small to prove anything other than that there is 
indeed variation of piece size for Metainfo files in the wild, it does indicate 
that Metainfo files may decrease the piece size for small torrents to get more 
pieces for the swarm to exchange and conversely, increase the piece size for 
very large torrents to keep the number of pieces to a reasonable number for the 
swarm.
