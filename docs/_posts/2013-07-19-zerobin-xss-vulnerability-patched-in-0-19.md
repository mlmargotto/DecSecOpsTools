Sébastien Sauvague has just informed me that he has released Version 0.19 to
address the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability that I wrote about in my
previous [blog post](/blog/zerobin-as-a-xss-attack-platform/). You
can find it at
[https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin/releases/0.19](https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin/releases/0.19)

Websites that host the ZeroBin software should update to this latest
version.  Although the more modern browsers may mitigate a XSS attack, there
is still a large number of browsers in portable devices, embedded systems, and
other software applications that may not so, it is still very important to
sanitize all input.
