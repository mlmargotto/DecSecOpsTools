Earlier this week media outlets had a field day with the news story about
Daniel Casillo, the guy who swam up to the JFK runway, climbed 8 feet of barbed
wire, walked across two runways and then entered Delta's terminal
3. [(See the ABC News Story.)](http://abcnews.go.com/US/jet-skier-breaks-jfk-airports-100-million-security/story?id=16992190#.UCq1_1ZlT1Y)

Apparently this all went undetected until a Delta employee noticed the guy in
the terminal, all dripping wet wearing his bright yellow life jacket.  Yikes!

Naturally, this type of news story is inflammatory and obviously mistakes were
made.  Since I am not in any way connected with the incident, I can talk about
it--unlike the folks dealing with all of the fallout there at JFK, TSA, and
Homeland Security.  This posting is not about taking cheap shots at the
hardworking people trying to secure the airport and since there is undoubtedly
lots of information that will never be made public, I will stick to defensible
high level lessons that we (as the public) can learn.

## Incident Handling

The general approach to Incident Handling holds that there are six phases.
These are:

* **Preparation**--Steps taken in advance to reduce the impact of an incident,
in the event that it occurs.
* **Identification**--Detection that an incident has occurred to trigger an
incident response.  The goal being detection as early as possible to reduce the
impact.
* **Containment**--Steps taken reduce the spread of the security breach.  For
instance to keep malware from spreading to other systems than haven't been
infected or to prevent a physical intruder from breaching deeper into sensitive
systems.
Eradication--Cleaning up and removing the artifacts left by the attacker.
Recovery--Returning systems to a state of normal or a new normal, as the case
may be.
* **Lessons Learned**--Determining what went wrong and improving operations to
prevent it from happening again.

These phases do not always apply in all situations and obviously a malware
outbreak is handled differently than a physical security breach.  During the
Lessons Learned exercise, it is helpful review the actions taken during each of
the preceding phases.  Let's do that, because it is very instructive.

### Preparation

The media has loved to state the 100 Million Dollar price tag for the airport's
Raytheon's Perimeter Intrusion Detection System.  The lesson here is that
technologies are not solutions.  No amount of money can solve the problem, by
itself.  Solutions are about _**people**_ and _**processes**_ as
well as _technology._

Think about the complexity of a system that costs $100MM.  Think about the
complexity of a system that would be required to secure the perimeter of an
airport the size of JFK.  Consider the quantity of inputs for each section of
fencing and each door.  I wonder how many false alarms they have per day.  I
wonder if they ever "mask" the inputs when environmental conditions (such as
snow or ice) interfere with the proper functioning of the devices.  What is the
policy for masking and unmasking the alarm inputs?

There are two security concepts that come into play--_defense-in-depth_
and _compensating controls_.  The concept of defense-in-depth is about
designing multiple overlapping controls (security measures) so that if a single
control does not function as expected, there are other controls that are still
effective.  The idea behind compensating controls is that if a control (such as
a door alarm) is not operational; it is augmented by another control (such as a
security guard).

When you read the story about the Jet Skier, it is easy to see that the
concepts of defense-in-depth and compensating controls were violated.  This is
conjecture only, but I suspect that this was not a failure in the original
_technical design_.  I would also speculate that it is quite likely not
even a failure in the _process design_, that is to say the Policies and
Procedures around masking alarm inputs.  Most likely it was a failure of
leadership, in not enforcing those policies.

### Identification

Surely, the JFK perimeter intrusion detection system must have been designed
with early warning alarms to alert security to an intruder on the periphery.
We have already discussed defense-in-depth.  The reason that this _is_ a
public relations fiasco is because multiple layers of security _must
_have failed for Casillo to have reached the terminal undetected by
security.  Perhaps the system did detect the guy, but "detective controls"
require a security guard to respond with appropriate action.  The key take-away
here is that the earlier an intrusion is detected and responded to the lower
the impact will be.  Think of the non-story this would be if the instant
Casillo started to climb the fence a security vehicle confronted him.

## Containment

With regard to a physical security incident in progress, containment means
keeping intruders from penetrating further into your sensitive areas than they
already are when they were detected and the event was determined to be a
security incident. Ideally, this is before the intruder reaches any sensitive
areas like planes or airport terminals.

### Eradication

In an airport security breach, the eradication can be the hard part.  It was
not simply a matter of arresting Daniel Casillo on charges of criminal
trespassing.  They also had to make absolutely sure of the security of the
airplanes near that terminal before they could take off.  This eradication
phase would be easiest if they have complete video coverage of the intruder
from the moment he climbed the fence until they arrested him.  Otherwise it
could involve physical inspection of the airplanes.  This is where preparation
phase pays off.

### Recovery

The recovery phase involves giving the all clear after validating that it is
safe to return to normal operations.  This decision is made by management after
making sure that eradication is complete, but continuing to monitor the
situation to make sure that eradication was successful.

### Lessons Learned

In the ABC article posted above, the Port Authority is quoted as calling for an
"expedited review of the incident and a complete investigation to determine how
Raytheon's perimeter intrusion detection system-which exceeds federal
requirements-could be improved."  Based on the quote, it seems as if the Port
Authority is already assigning blame--prior to the investigation.  The
_Lessons Learned_ phase could be quite painful for the security team
involved and I empathize with them.  But, this is how improvements are made.

If they focus on just the technology and its manufacturer and not the people or
the processes around how it is used then it is quite likely that they will not
have learned all that much after all.

## Final Thoughts

We really do not know the motivation of Daniel Casillo.  I suspect that he
probably was just tired, cold, and frustrated.  But allegedly, he did climb a
fence (a preventive control) and ignore signage (a deterrent control).  None
the less, I do hope that he is dealt with gracefully.

Lastly, it is unlikely that we will know many of the details of the specific
failures because they would reveal sensitive information that would be useful
to an attacker with truly malicious intentions.  An insider with more complete
information may think that I am way off base--If so please forgive me.
However, because there is learning value in dissecting this incident as
reported I have done so.
