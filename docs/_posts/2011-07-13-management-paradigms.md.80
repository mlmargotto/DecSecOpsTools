While recently accompanying an executive as he visited four newly acquired 
dialysis facilities for the first time, I was struck once again by the 
importance of **Management by Wandering Around** (MBWA)*. Intentionally 
wandering through your organization allows you, as a leader, to observe reality 
and hear concerns from the front line in an informal manner. When you listen, 
it sends a powerful message that you truly do care. When talking with others, I 
try to remember to put them at ease, by considering their communication style. 
Certain people like to get right down to business, while others want to create 
a personal connection by discussing something safe, like the weather, at first.

At the other end of the spectrum, is **Management by Objectives** (MBO). MBO 
maps each person’s performance goals to company strategy. This is a more 
formal strategy, and certainly has its place. Each employee should understand 
how their contribution fits into their group, department, and the entire 
organization. Progress toward the objectives should be discussed regularly on 
both a formal and informal basis. Your staff knows what is important to 
you—it’s the items that you check up on.

Lastly, there is one other technique—**Management by Exception** (MBE). MBE 
tracks the specific key performance indicators of a process and flags the 
output that is not at an acceptable level. MBE can be a very useful tool, and 
the effort of deciding what to measure and how to measure it provides very 
important discussion topics for your teams. Information systems, can ease the 
score-keeping burden, but the discussion is still crucial.

As a leader, you want to establish the strategy (MBO) and operating parameters 
(MBE) and then inspire and fuel the discussion by MBWA.
