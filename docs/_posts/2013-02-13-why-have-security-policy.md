I have found that not everyone has considered the role of security policy in an
organization’s information security management program.  Therefore, I will
share some of my insights with the hope that it will help others articulate it
to their organizations.

A Security Policy is a written document that states management’s intentions
with regard to a particular aspect of security.  Take, for example, a policy on
passwords.  The policy may state at a high level that passwords are to be
protected, unique, and of a sufficient strength.  Based on the policy,
additional documents such as procedures and guidelines may be created, but it
is the policy that creates the foundational basis for the other documents that
get created out to carry out the management expectation.

This is why an auditor will want to start with the organization’s security
policies.  Auditors are looking for evidence that the management understands
the compliance requirement and has codified it with a corresponding policy.  Of
course, they will then go on to look for additional evidence that the policy
was implemented by looking for other artifacts.

Above and beyond the role that policy plays in an audit, the policy also
creates a mandate for the organization.  If the policy was important enough for
the management to write it down and to approve it, then the folks who are
charged with executing the policy can reasonably expect management support as
needed when enforcing it.

As a security professional, I am often asked whether something is “okay from
a security perspective.”  The last thing that I would want is my decision to
be perceived as arbitrary; therefore I look to our security policies for
guidance.  Security policies should capture the organizations past learning
about what needs to be done to keep the organization secure and should be
refined over time to reflect the changing needs of the business and the
increasing maturity of the information security management program.

Security Policies generally deal with the “what” and the “why” and
leave the detailed “how” to corresponding procedures.  Procedures, while
still mandatory, may not require the same high level of executive approval and
generally get into technology or implementation details that are not
appropriate for a policy.  Guidelines are not mandatory, but are useful to show
one or more ways of how to achieve compliance with a policy.

If an organization’s policies are complete and comprehensive, security
awareness becomes simply a matter of making sure that everyone is aware of the
organization's policies and the consequences and business risks of not
following the policies.  After all, what organization does not want to “say
what they do and do what they say?”
