## A Mission from God, Blues Brothers Style: Kenneth G. Hartman

I met Kenneth G. Hartman at a security event in Madison in a few years ago and 
we’ve stayed in touch. I’m impressed with his creative approach to security 
as well as life, and he’s definitely provided great input for this site. Ken 
also jumped at the opportunity to write a guest post, and it’s fantastic! –

## If you always do what you have always done, you will always get what you 
have always gotten

Recently, I was leading the information security program for a Cloud Hosting 
and Managed Service Provider.  We were under a tight deadline to achieve ISO 
27001 Certification for our information security management system to meet 
contractual commitments to an important customer that was looking to grow their 
business with my company.  When a company implements ISO 27001 properly, the 
process is a transformative experience that facilitates top-down engagement in 
information security management and sets up a framework to improve the maturity 
of a security program.  However, as the days ticked by, I had an increasing 
realization that we needed to kick it up a quantum level.  As the old saying 
goes, “if you always do what you have always done, you will always get what 
you have always gotten.”

A leadership vacuum is an indication that you need to step up and lead.  
Don’t wait for permission!
At the time, I was frustrated at the lack of some basic security measures that 
were not in place.  Initially, I wanted to blame someone—my predecessor, my 
boss, the bureaucracy, anyone or anything.  Then it occurred to me that if 
changes were going to be made, it would have to be a result of my instigation. 
As I see it, a leadership vacuum is an indication that you need to step up and 
lead.  Don’t wait for permission.

As an avid reader of books on business leadership, I had recalled reading about 
how Robert Townsend, the former CEO of Avis, used to carry around a resignation 
letter in his pocket in case someone had an issue with his efforts at slashing 
company red tape.  I may have been a bit too dramatic, but I started telling 
people that my job was on the line over this ISO 27001 certification.

## Damn it…we are going to be like the Blues Brothers…We are on a mission 
from God!

I called my InfoSec team together and told them that things were about to 
change.  “From now on, when we are right, we are not going to take no for an 
answer.  Either the company is serious about this certification or they are 
not.  Either they are serious about protecting customer trust or they are 
not.”  I said, “Damn it…we are going to be like the Blues Brothers…We 
are on a mission from God!”

**At the time, I did not know how powerful the Blues Brothers metaphor would be 
for our team.** All I knew was I was tired of the status quo and decided that 
we were going to actively engage the company according to our security 
improvement agenda.  We started expanding our vulnerability scanning and 
pushing for shortened patching windows and improving our hardening—all things 
that are hard to argue with, but required the active participation of multiple 
groups beyond our InfoSec team.  These conversations were not easy, but we were 
on a mission.

## The Blues Brothers pursued their objective with gusto and panache

The Blues Brothers inspired us, because not only of their mission focus, but 
because they pursued their objective with gusto and panache.  The Blues 
Brothers reminded us that it was ok to have fun and not take ourselves too 
seriously.  In security, there is a lot of “blocking and tackling,” the 
mundane work that has to happen so that everything runs smoothly.  Suddenly, 
this work was not as burdensome as the team started to get a shared vision of 
what was possible.  We started to have fun again.  “We are on a mission” 
became our rally cry and we reminded each other of this when discussing 
challenges and roadblocks.  We did achieve the ISO certification, by the way, 
and the team has an even more aggressive agenda for this year.  I have since 
taken a job at Google but I know that I have imparted the team with a new 
perspective on how to think about their career as InfoSec Rock Stars and that 
is with Blues Brothers style.

## Why not aspire to be an InfoSec Rock Star where you are?

Not everyone is going to be a Security Consultant Rock Star, but why not aspire 
to be an InfoSec Rock Star where you are?  In a corporate job, it is easy to 
become complacent.  That is my biggest fear.  Companies need leaders at all 
levels, but many will settle for folks that just show up.  One of my favorite 
quotations is “the only job security is excellence.”  If you are excellent, 
you will always be able to find work.  Be excellent and then use that job 
security to push the organization past the status quo.  Create a mandate; your 
company will thank you.

## “Do cool shit every day, or die trying!”

In his book “Brand You,” Tom Peters posed the rhetorical question on how to 
become excellent and his response was “stop doing non-excellent stuff!”  He 
actually went on to say “do cool shit every day, or die trying!”  To me, 
that is the rock star way.  If you do not have any epic war stories, go make 
some…Damn it 🙂
