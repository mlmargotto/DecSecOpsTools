All good things must come to an end.  The Oz Data Centa (ozdc.net) was a very
useful tool for monitoring PasteBin and I, for one will miss it.  The site was
run by Lee Johnstone and had an innovative method of cataloging data breaches
that were dumped to PasteBin.  Read the [blog
post](/blog/looking-in-pastebin-at-the-hactivism-carnage/) that I wrote
discussing how I would often use this amazing tool.
