This post is a response to a variety of discussions that I have had lately with 
a variety of customers, executives, salespeople, and even engineers that are 
working on security projects for a variety of companies.  Sometimes, it seems, 
that encryption is positioned as the “Magic Bullet” that will cure all of 
their data protection woes.  Worse yet, some will say that the “emperor has 
no clothes” or call their project “security theater.”

Encryption is not a magic bullet, but it does it play a vital role in a 
company’s data protection strategy.  Most people are aware that there are two 
high-level types of encryption. These are <em>encryption-at-rest</em> and 
<em>encryption-in-transit</em>.  Because an end-to-end encryption commitment 
uses both types of encryption in various ways, it is important to dive just a 
little deeper to eliminate any confusion when a cloud service provider is 
discussing encryption.

# Encryption-at-rest

The security goal of encryption-at-rest is to provide access control by 
permitting only the authorized users or processes to view or alter the 
unencrypted data. As a result, it protects the integrity and confidentiality of 
the data.  Unauthorized users or processes will see ciphertext.  Ciphertext 
looks like random data and has no discernible patterns or meaning.

The most important thing to remember when thinking about encryption-at-rest is 
that <em>the entity which holds the encryption/decryption key is responsible 
for enforcing access control</em>.  Encryption can be applied at different 
layers to mitigate various types of threats pertaining to unauthorized access.  
For example, sometimes this is implemented at the storage layer using 
self-encrypting disks.  In this case, the storage operating system holds the 
key.  If a disk drive is removed and connected to another system, the data will 
not be able to be read.  It is important to note that if an attacker can come 
through the operating system that <em>is authorized</em> to use the storage 
system, this type of encryption will be ineffective.  This kind of encryption 
is also known as **<em>transparent disk encryption</em>** because the 
encryption and decryption operations operate in a manner that is transparent to 
the operating system.

Moving up a layer, there is also **<em>transparent database encryption</em>**. 
The database system performs the encryption, and it is indeed transparent to 
the applications which store data in the database.  Because the database 
management system holds the key, it has the access control responsibility. 
Access to the data must be made via the database management system, which will 
typically implement role-based access control.  Anyone attempting to access the 
data by circumventing the database management system will only see ciphertext.

With **<em>application-layer encryption</em>**, the application holds the 
encryption key in memory and encrypts specific fields before inserting them 
into the database. Therefore, the application performs the access control 
duties. If the database administrator directly queries the database, all that 
will be returned are records that contain ciphertext.

So far we have talked about three different types of data encryption at rest, 
but what about the storage of the encryption keys? Typically, a **<em>Hardware 
Security Module (HSM)</em>** is used to store the keys and provides other 
important security features.

Encryption keys should never be stored with the application or the data they 
encrypt.  Sadly, this is sometimes the case.  Instead, when the application or 
database initializes, it will authenticate itself to the HSM and will obtain 
its keys using specific function calls that perform the key handling operations 
securely.

In addition to storing keys, Hardware Security Modules provide features for 
automating the key management processes.  Any manual key handling processes 
require the cooperation of two different people to achieve what is known as 
“split control,” a security best practice.  HSMs are also tamper-resistant 
and will shred the keys if someone tries to open the physical container.

# Encryption-in-transit

The security goal of encryption-in-transit is to create a secure communication 
channel between two processes or people so as to protect the confidentiality 
and integrity of the information exchanged.  The security of the channel is 
typically attacked by trying to eavesdrop or attempting to take a 
man-in-the-middle (MITM) position between the two parties that are 
communicating.

For an attacker to achieve a man-in-the-middle position, they must impersonate 
the client to the server and impersonate the server to the client.  It is for 
this reason that it is imperative to authenticate the parties that are 
attempting to communicate securely.  The server typically asserts its identity 
using a web server certificate that the client trusts.  Sometimes the client 
will also use a certificate that the server trusts to authenticate itself to 
the server and other times the client authentication is left to the web 
application login functionality.  Obviously, it is important that the login 
credentials are not passed to an imposter.

Many organizations are either moving to encryption between internal services or 
have already implemented it.  By requiring mutual authentication and encryption 
for services that exchange sensitive data with other services within an 
organization’s production environment, this enables the “least privilege” 
security tenant.  Each system or service only needs to talk to only a few other 
specific systems or services that need to consume its data.

# What could go wrong?

Most people know better than to create their own cryptographic algorithms.  
Security through obscurity never works, especially with encryption.  For this 
reason, it is important to use only ciphers that have withstood the test of 
time with lots of public scrutiny.  Security should depend on the secrecy of 
the key and not the secrecy of the algorithm.  Assuming that an industry 
accepted cipher such as the advanced encryption standard (AES) is used, there 
is still lots of room for implementation issues.  Implementation issues could 
be another lengthy post, but two of the most common tend to be keeping both an 
unencrypted copy of the data along with the encrypted data or mishandling the 
encryption key.  The main point here is that it is important to do a complete 
security analysis of an organization's encryption rather than just to accept 
that they have the encryption magic bullet.
