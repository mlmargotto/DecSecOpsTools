Sébastien Sauvague has just informed me that he has released Version 0.19 to 
address the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability that I wrote about in my 
previous <a href="/blog/zerobin-as-a-xss-attack-platform/">blog post</a>. You 
can find it at <a 
href="https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin/releases/0.19">https://github.com/se
bsauvage/ZeroBin/releases/0.19</a>

Websites that host the ZeroBin software should update to this latest 
version.  Although the more modern browsers may mitigate a XSS attack, there 
is still a large number of browsers in portable devices, embedded systems, and 
other software applications that may not so, it is still very important to 
sanitize all input.
