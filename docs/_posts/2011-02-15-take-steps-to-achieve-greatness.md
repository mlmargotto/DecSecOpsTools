My New Year's resolution this year is to be more “intentional.” Maybe it
was the movie _Click, _where Adam Sandler stars as a harried workaholic
in possession of a magical remote control that allows him to fast-forward
through life. Or, maybe I'm starting to take the age-old axiom that “those
who fail to plan—plan to fail” to heart. When I think about what makes some
of my heroes great, I have come to conclude that they intend to be great and
that they plan to be great. But more important, they take steps to be great.

One author who has had a significant influence on me, John Maxwell, has written
a book called _Today Matters._ In this book, Maxwell discusses how the
little steps we take each day accumulate to become the distance traveled on the
path to success.

So how do we become more intentional about quality and continuous improvement?
I think the answer lies in consistently taking little steps in the right
direction. This is something that I call "iterative improvement." Sometimes
baby steps can be frustrating when one sees the big picture vision of
everything that is possible; at other times it's gratifying when one notices
how much ground has been covered.

Here are my thoughts about how to get started:

* Identify all your stakeholders.
* Determine what your stakeholders value.
* Use a [Plan-Do-Act-Check cycle](/blog/plan-do-check-act/). Make sure that
your plan includes measurable improvements toward improving on how your
organization meets one or more stakeholder values.

I've found that the busier a person is, the more intentional the person must
become to make sure that the _urgent_ does not crowd out the
_important._ By making measurements along the way, you'll have a
yardstick to measure progress.
