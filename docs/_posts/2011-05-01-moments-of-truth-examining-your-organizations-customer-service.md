Have you ever been frustrated with customer service at a big bureaucracy, such
as the Department of Motor Vehicles? Every interaction between people within an
organization creates an impression in the minds of all who witness the
interaction. These "moments of truth" are snapshots that reveal the character
of an organization.

In the book _[Momen ts of Truth](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060915803/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060915803&linkCode=as2&tag=kennetcom-20)
, _Jan Carlzon urges leaders to experience various customer
service interactions from the perspective of the customer. As an example,
Carlzon suggests anonymously calling the company switchboard to see how the
receptionist greets customers. Carlzon, an airline executive, often flew on
various flights in an unreserved seat to emphasize that he wanted the other
passengers to get the same treatment that employees would give him.

One of the axioms for the Total Quality Movement is that the _customer is
the judge of the feast_. Therefore, if an organization desires to improve
the quality of the services they provide, it is imperative to multiply the
positive moments of truth and reduce the negative interactions. As leaders
pursuing quality improvement, we must raise the awareness of the collective
impact that moments of truth have and create a culture that encourages, even
inspires, great customer service. As your team focuses on how to improve
customer service, you will find a corresponding improvement in the quality of
your service.

In addition to the book _Moments of Truth, _the folks at
[QBQ, Inc.](http://www.qbq.com/) have great resources to help foster the
culture of personal responsibility that engenders excellent service and
quality. Also, here's [an article](/dead-link/) that has some great ideas on
how to apply the Moments of Truth concept in a health care environment.
