After extensive searching the InterWebs and finding a lack of documentation on
how to install [TShark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html)
in a silent/unattended mode, I came across a related
[StackExchange post](http://superuser.com/questions/164553/automatically-answer-yes-when-using-apt-get-install)
by Franck Dernoncourt that got me on the right track.  

Here is what I came up with for Debian:

```
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install tshark
```

## Background

For a pet project I am working on, I am creating an install script to install
several security tools onto a virtual machine and got stuck when TShark 
popped the following Qt screen:

![Qt Screen for configuring
wireshark](https://kennethghartman.com/images/Configuring_wireshark-common-1-300x120.png)

My goal is to have everything installed and properly configured without a
user's involvement.  There are several
[resources](http://superuser.com/questions/319865/how-to-set-up-wireshark-to-run-without-root-on-debian)
that show how
to run Wireshark (TSHARK) as non-root, but that is not what I wanted.  I was
ok with the default "<No>" but wanted to avoid being prompted for it.
