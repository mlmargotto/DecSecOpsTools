In my [last post](/blog/change-config-settings-using-a-bash-script/), I
discussed using sed, the stream editor to make configuration file changes via a
bash script.  There are two important factors to keep in mind:

* Many configuration files can only be modified as root, and
* The location of configuration files will vary depending on the Linux
distribution.

Therefore it is important to test for both of these conditions at the beginning
of your Bash script.

## Test to ensure expected OS Distribution and Version

```
#Test to ensure expected OS Distribution and Version
OSTEST=$(grep "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6." /etc/*release | wc
-c)
if [ $OSTEST == 0 ]
then
echo "Incorrect Operating System - Expected RHE6"
exit 1
fi
```

The example above example is for Red Hat, so the string to grep will vary
depending on the Linux distribution.

## Test to Ensure Script is Run as Root

```
#Test to ensure script is run as root
USERTEST=$(whoami)
if [ $USERTEST != "root" ]
then
echo "Incorrect Permissions - Run this script as root"
exit 1
fi
```

You may prefer a tight one-liner to test for root.  In that case you can use
something like:

```
# Check for root
[ "$(id -u)" -ne 0 ] && echo "Incorrect Permissions - Run this script as root"
&& exit 1
```
