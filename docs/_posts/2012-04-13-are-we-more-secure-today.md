Yesterday I was asked a question in passing.  The question was this --_Are
we more secure today?_  My reflexive answer was “yes, we get more secure
every day.”  After all, how else could I justify my employment?  This
question challenged me on many levels.  The first thoughts were how can you
qualitatively measure security?  Do we _feel_ more secure today?  Why do
I _feel_ more secure today?  Is it based on what my security experts
told me?  And what are they basing their opinion on?

Next my thoughts turned to the lessons of 9/11 and the asymmetric nature of the
cyber-security battle.  In cyber security, just like homeland security…”we
have to be right all the time and the bad guys just have to be right once.”
Just last week, Shawn Henry the FBI's “top cyber cop” told the Wall Street
Journal that more and more FBI agents, while working on other cases, are
encountering data stolen from companies who had no idea that their systems had
been compromised.

"We have found their data in the middle of other investigations,'' he
said."They are shocked and, in many cases, they've been breached for many
months, in some cases years, which means that an adversary had full visibility
into everything occurring on that network, potentially.'' [(See the WSJ article.)](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304177104577307773326180032.html)

What does being “more secure” mean?  Security is about managing risks, not
eliminating them.  After all, every transaction has inherent risk because trust
is involved.  So a proper answer to the question “Are we more secure today”
really involves a discussion about risk.  Risk drives the train.  Ok, so are we
better at managing our risks today?

There are two types of risks---the known and the unknown.  The best thing about
known risks is that they can be managed.  An important first step is
identifying all of the risks and then prioritizing them.  In the field of
security, risk is defined as the likelihood of a threat acting on a specific
vulnerability.  Once risks are known, management of the risks involves
decisions to either accept the risk or reduce it to an acceptable level.  Risks
can also be transferred.  This is often done with insurance policies or
contractual service level agreements.

Security is less about deploying technology--it’s more about doing the right
things, right.  In that sense, security is closely related to quality assurance
and financial management.  There are security industry benchmark measurements
that can be used to quantitatively measure security improvement efforts.  World
class companies have hard measurements that can be used to answer the daily
question--are we more secure today?  Implementing metrics requires
organizational process maturity and some tactical investments in technology. In
depth knowledge of one’s current security posture will allow the organization
to chart a course for sustainable security improvement, and this really should
be the goal of every company.
