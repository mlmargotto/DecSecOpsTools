![The Trust-Value Equation](https://kennethghartman.com/images/Trust-Value-Equation.png)

Benefit can be thought of as a ratio of utility to unfriendliness. No matter
how user-friendly an application is, if a customer gains no utility from using
the service, there is no incentive to use it.  Conversely, waiting in line at
the Division of Motor Vehicles is a great example of what is typically an
“unfriendly” experience.  However, the utility of a driver’s license is
enormous and worth the inconvenience.

Now, let’s consider the other side of the equation—Fear, Uncertainty, and
Doubt.  Imagine a patient is contemplating brain surgery.  It is natural for
the patient to have all kinds of fear and uncertainty about the operation.  In
fact, she would forgo the procedure if she had serious doubts about the brain
surgeon’s competency or her likelihood of a positive outcome for the surgery.
 Years ago, my grandma was in this very same situation.  In her mid-80’s, she
had a brain surgery to remove a tumor.  She agreed to have the surgery after
family members (which included my brother, a physician) looked into the risks
and complications of the surgery and met with the surgeon.  Unfortunately, the
surgery did not eliminate the cancer, and she decided not to have a second
surgery.  She soon passed away.

I have purposefully used two examples that did not specifically involve
computer systems in an attempt to make the Trust-Value Equation universally
applicable.  Now, let's shift the discussion to cloud services.  In the typical
sales process, the decision makers at the customer organization are attracted
by the benefits provided by the application and impressed with the usability of
the application.  Naturally, the next question is, “can I trust this
application and the organization with our data?”

Savvy customers will have a systematic security review process that delves into
the specific security controls that the service organization uses to protect
customer data.  Sophisticated and demanding customers are quite likely going to
find some gaps and weaknesses in the security posture of the service provider.
This is to be expected because these organizations are rapidly evolving to meet
marketplace opportunities and security investments involve decisions about
tradeoffs that the customer may not fully appreciate.

In other words, it boils down to this question:

> _“Do I trust that is the application secure enough for me for me to use
for my commercial advantage?”_

I believe that this is an ongoing calculation where customers continuously ask
themselves whether the trust-value equation assumptions have changed.  Service
providers must focus on tilting the equation ever more in their favor by:

* Increasing the utility of the service,
* Improving the user-friendliness of the service, and
* Enhancing the perceived trustworthiness of the service.

Naturally, the best way to enhance the perceived trustworthiness of the
application is to improve its security such that it will withstand scrutiny
from each customer’s security experts.  It is also important to articulate
the security considerations of the service in a credible way without
overstating it.

As you create and consume various services, consider this trust-value equation
and how you can make it work in your favor.
