Quality results from quality processes. This is true for organizational
performance and clinical outcomes every bit as much as it is true for
manufactured products. A process can be thought of as a systematic
transformation of inputs to create a desired output. Too often, the people who
use the process are blamed for poor quality resultsâ€”even when poor quality
stems from a shortcoming in the process itself.

A quality-driven organization will not only define the critical steps in their
processes, they will measure those critical steps. Measuring defined processes
provides insight into the adequacy of the process as well as the adequacy of
the training on the process. Process metrics can also help organizations
anticipate adverse trends and make adjustments, thereby keeping their processes
under control.
