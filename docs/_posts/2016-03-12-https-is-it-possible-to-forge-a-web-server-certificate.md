Yes, it is possible in theory to forge the Web Server Certificate that is used
in SSL/TLS communication. This is because the certificate is signed by a
certificate authority that your browser trusts using a cryptographic hashing
algorithm of a specific length. The hashing algorithms that have been used to
sign certificates are (from newest to oldest) SHA256, SHA1, and MD5. The output
of a MD5 hash function is 128 bits, while a SHA1 digest is 160 bits, and a
SHA256 is (you guessed it) 256 bits. One of the design features of a
cryptographic hashing algorithm is that it is infeasible to predict the output
(the “digest”) based on its input. However, for any hash function, there
are only a limited number of possible outputs, although this is a very large
number. The number of possible digests doubles for every additional bit added
to the length of the digest.

When two different inputs to a given hash function generate the same digest, it
is called a “collision.” At a conceptual level, the fact that collisions
are possible should make sense because there are literally an infinite number
of possible inputs but only a large, but finite number of outputs of a hash
function. However, even though collisions are theoretically possible, in
practice they are computationally expensive to determine, particularly when
trying to identify a second certificate that creates the same digest of the
certificate that you are attempting to forge.

As an example, Bruce Schneier, a crypto expert wrote a blog post in 2012
projecting that it would take about $700,000 to generate a bogus SHA1 Web
Server Certificate in 2015 using Amazon EC2 pricing. More importantly, he
predicted that the price would drop to about $43k by 2021. (See
[When Will We See Collisions for SHA-1?](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/when_will_we_se.html)
)

It is for this reason that the internet community is moving away from SHA1
Certificates to SHA256 Certificates. In 2008, a group of security researchers
actually published details on how they forged the MD5 certificate of a
Certificate Authority using a collision-based attack. (See
[MD5 considered harmful today](http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/)
).
This research hastened the move away from MD5 to SHA1.
There are other innovations that such as Certificate Transparency and
Certificate Pinning that also help to mitigate the threat of a forged web
server certificate in practice. But those are potential topics for future posts.
