> <em>Success has many fathers, while failure is an orphan
> --Anonymous</em>

I collect quotes.  I love them and reflect on them and let them inspire me.
This one is a favorite.  The common interpretation of this proverb is that many
people are all too willing to take credit for a success but disavow any
complicity in a failure. But ponder for a moment, a double meaning:

> <em>“Success is due to many sponsors, while isolation leads to
failure.”</em>

Early in my career, I learned about the Pygmalion Effect.  Pygmalion was the
mythological artist who fell in love with his sculpture of a beautiful woman,
which subsequently came to life.  This is often used to illustrate the concept
of the “self-fulfilling prophesy” and the results of studies from the late
1960’s that demonstrated that the greater the expectations placed on people,
the better they perform.  Hence, it made sense to me that selecting the right
mentors and sponsors mattered to my success.

During my study of the martial arts, I learned that even the legendary karate
masters all had masters that they revered.  After all, how can you learn
martial arts all by yourself?

I also had the opportunity to be part of a start-up company.  We had a great
team and we also had great investors.  It was there that I learned about J.
Paul Getty’s axiom, “If you owe the bank $100 that's your problem. If you
owe the bank $100 million, that's the bank's problem.”  I learned that you
want the right investors, and you want them to have skin in the game—so that
they are invested in your success.

Now I am back in the corporate world, driving change.  This means meeting with
various “sponsors” to get my idea approved. However, Lao Tzu said “When
the best leader's work is done the people say, ‘We did it ourselves.'”  If
I truly want my ideas adopted, they must become <em>everyone’s ideas.
</em>This means being more concerned about the power of the idea, than my
ownership of the idea.

Where did I get such a counter-intuitive notion?  My virtual mentors of course.
 People like Seth Godin, whose many books have stretched my thinking throughout
the years.   Godin wants people to steal his ideas and make them their own.
And it’s working toward his success; people can’t get enough of his books.

And Doc Searls, with his <a
href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/ten-ideas-about-ideas">Ten Ideas
about Ideas</a> blog post. He makes the point that “Ideas won’t change the
world unless others can improve on them.” Hmm, it’s no wonder that success
has many fathers.
